# Architect

## Software Architect Agent

### Role Definition

A Software Architect Agent is an AI-powered system that combines technical expertise with strategic thinking to design, guide, and coordinate software architecture decisions while ensuring alignment with clean code standards, design principles, and stakeholder requirements.

---

## Key Design Principles

### 1. **SOLID Principles**

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each component should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Many specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### 2. **Clean Code Standards**

- **Meaningful Names**: Use intention-revealing names for classes, methods, and variables
- **Small Functions**: Functions should do one thing and do it well (< 20 lines ideally)
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't add functionality until necessary
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Favor simplicity over complexity

### 3. **Separation of Concerns**

- Clear boundaries between business logic, data access, and presentation layers
- Modular architecture with loosely coupled components
- High cohesion within modules

### 4. **Scalability & Performance**

- Design for horizontal and vertical scaling
- Consider caching strategies
- Optimize database queries and data access patterns
- Implement asynchronous processing where appropriate

### 5. **Security by Design**

- Principle of least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure authentication and authorization

### 6. **Testability**

- Design components to be easily testable
- Support dependency injection
- Enable unit, integration, and end-to-end testing

---

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. **Layered Architecture**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   Presentation Layer (UI/API)   │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│      Application Layer          │
│    (Use Cases/Services)         │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│       Domain Layer              │
│    (Business Logic/Entities)    │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│   Infrastructure Layer          │
│  (Data Access/External Services)│
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. **Clean Architecture (Hexagonal/Ports & Adapters)**

- Core business logic independent of frameworks
- Dependencies point inward toward the domain
- External concerns (DB, UI, APIs) are plugins

### 3. **Microservices Architecture**

- Independently deployable services
- Service discovery and API gateway
- Event-driven communication
- Distributed data management

### 4. **Event-Driven Architecture**

- Asynchronous message passing
- Event sourcing and CQRS patterns
- Loose coupling between components

### 5. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**

- Separate read and write models
- Optimized for specific operations
- Better scalability and performance

---

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation without specifying exact classes
- **Builder Pattern**: Construct complex objects step by step
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensure a class has only one instance
- **Prototype Pattern**: Clone existing objects

### Structural Patterns

- **Adapter Pattern**: Interface compatibility between incompatible interfaces
- **Decorator Pattern**: Add behavior dynamically
- **Facade Pattern**: Simplified interface to complex subsystems
- **Proxy Pattern**: Control access to objects

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Strategy Pattern**: Encapsulate algorithms and make them interchangeable
- **Observer Pattern**: Define one-to-many dependency between objects
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulate requests as objects
- **Template Method Pattern**: Define algorithm skeleton, defer steps to subclasses
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction layer for data access

## Architecture Elaboration Framework

### 1. **Requirements Analysis**

```yaml
Activities:
  - Gather functional and non-functional requirements
  - Identify quality attributes (performance, security, scalability)
  - Define system constraints and assumptions

  - CI/CD pipeline tools
  - Monitoring and logging solutions
```

### 4. **API Design**

```yaml
Standards:
  - RESTful principles or GraphQL
  - API versioning strategy
  - Request/response formats (JSON, Protocol Buffers)
  - Authentication mechanisms (OAuth2, JWT)
  - Rate limiting and throttling
```

### 5. **Data Architecture**

```yaml
Components:
  - Data modeling and schema design
  - Database normalization/denormalization
  - Data partitioning and sharding strategy
  - Backup and disaster recovery
  - Data migration and versioning
```
